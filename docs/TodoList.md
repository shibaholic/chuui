# Todo List

1. Backend review system
   - TrackedEntry
     - Creation, deletion
     - Status state machine
   - ReviewEvent
     - Score algorithm
2. Backend tag system
   - EF core M-to-N
3. Backend user JWT configuration
   - Integration testing!!!!!
4. Switch to packaging the JMdict data with the application
   - Migration would be done manually by the Admin anyways for the most part.
   - Makes testing and seeding data easier and faster.
