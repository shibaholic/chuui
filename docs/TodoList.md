# Todo List

1. ✅ Backend review system
   - TrackedEntry
     - Creation, deletion
     - Status state machine
   - ReviewEvent
2. ✅ Backend tag system
3. Backend user JWT configuration
   - Integration testing!!!!!
4. ✅ Switch to packaging the JMdict data with the application
   - Migration would be done manually by the Admin anyways for the most part.
   - Makes testing and seeding data easier and faster.

6. Review Score algorithm
